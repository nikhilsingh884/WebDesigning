        <ins>HTML</ins> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
        such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
        documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
        <em><strong>headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.</strong></em> HTML elements are
        delineated by tags,
        written using <ins> angle brackets.</ins> Tags such as <span style="color:green ;">&ltimg&gt </span> and
        <span style="color:green ;">&ltinput&gt </span> directly
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
        &ltp&gt surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
        Browsers do not
        display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
